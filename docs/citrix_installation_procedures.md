| 1    | Copy the installation files which are located in three directories on MECTXPRD01 in the D: partition to the D: partition of the new server. <br/>D:\Citrix Pres 4.0 <br/>D:\Citrix Hot Fix <br/>D:\Citrix Edge Site                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2    | Install Citrix Presentation Server 4.0 by following the SIG which is posted to MECTXPRD18 in the following directory D:\AA Citrix Environment Documentation\Run Books & SIG's\Completed\Citrix & Supporting Servers\American Airlines-Run Book-Citrix Presentation Server v 1.0.doc                                                                   |
| 3    | Using Presentation server publish an admin remote desktop for the newly installed server to avoid having to use the jump server for the remaining steps                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4    | After the installation is complete you must install the following patches form the Citrix Hot Fix directory from step 1. I have found this order seems to work best. UPH Clean, PSE400W2K3ROS.msp, VmWarereg Key, Smooth Roaming Hot Fix, Dual Monitor Hot Fix, and Citrix Hot Fix 9_25_07.                                                           |
| 5    | Install Citrix EdgeSight agent which is in the Citrix Edge Site directory from step 1. The only thing you should have to fill out is the company name use “AA”. I am attaching the deployment guide from Citrix to the email. Feel free to use EdgeSight. The deployment guide will explain how to access the reporting server located on MECTXPRD27. |
| 6    | Add the new server to the following AD group “L_M&E Citrix New Profile Servers” to allow the user profiles to be stored on the profile server in the Citrix farm.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
